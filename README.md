# Interview

This Angular app is on version 9.1. The purpose of this app is just to prepare for an interview by getting hands on with the topics below:

- Progressive Web Apps
- Service Workers
- Web Worker
- Angular Elements (Web Components)
- RxJs
- NgRx
- Promises
- Observable
- Redux
- Sass
- Angular Reactive Forms
- Angular Template Driven Forms
- Jasmine and Karma Unit Testing
- Protractor

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
